Pure Rust bindings to the Github V3 API. If you want bindings to the V4 library
see the [github-graphql-rs](./github-gql-rs) library.

## Incomplete Bindings
Please look at the [endpoints](./docs/endpoints.md) docs to see which endpoints
are currently covered in the API. This is for the Github V3 API.

## Dependencies and Support
github-rs is intended to work on all tier 1 supported Rust systems:

- Windows
- Linux
- MacOSX

github-rs supports [rustls] and [rust-native-tls] for TLS connectivity.
`rustls` is used by default, but one can toggle support with Cargo features:

```toml
[dependencies.github-rs]
version = "0.7"
default-features = false
features = ["rust-native-tls"]
```

Since `rustls` depends on [`ring`][ring] for cryptography, hardware support is
limited to what `ring` supports, currently ARM and x86 (both 32- and 64-bit).
If you're compiling for other architectures then you may use the
`rust-native-tls` feature for maximum portability.

[rust-native-tls]: https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls
[ring]: https://github.com/briansmith/ring

## Minimum Compiler Version
Due to the use of certain features github-rs requires rustc version 1.18 or
higher.

## Project Aims
- Have a robust API where everything is error handled properly to avoid
  panics of any kind. A library is the base of an application and should
  be a solid foundation to be built upon
- Cover all Github stable endpoints. Anything that's deprecated and beta
  should be obtained only through configuration for those features. As
  deprecated endpoints are removed from Github so too should they be
  removed from this library.
- Having stability as part of the API. As such effort will be
  taken to make sure this code compiles on stable Rust, rather than
  nightly.
- Ease of use. The complexity should be hidden from those not hacking on
  the code itself.
- Documentation of everything so not only is it easy to hack on but
  finding out how to use the library should be easy to find.

## Getting Started
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
github-rs = "0.7"
serde_json = "1.0"
```

Then in your `lib.rs` or `main.rs` file add:

```rust
use github_rs::client::{Executor, Github};
use serde_json::Value;
```

Now you can start making queries. Here's a small example to get your user
information:

```rust
use github_rs::client::{Executor, Github};
use serde_json::Value;

fn main() {
    let client = Github::new("API TOKEN").unwrap();
    let me = client.get()
                   .user()
                   .execute::<Value>();
    match me {
        Ok((headers, status, json)) => {
            println!("{:#?}", headers);
            println!("{}", status);
            if let Some(json) = json{
                println!("{}", json);
            }
        },
        Err(e) => println!("{}", e)
    }
}
```
